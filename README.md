Our project is titled "AI-Driven Digital Twin for Health Simulation", and the aim is to build an intelligent healthcare assistant that can simulate the effects of medical conditions, medications, and surgeries on the human body.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of our idea:

ðŸ©º Medical History Input: The user enters their conditions (e.g., diabetes, surgeries).

ðŸ§  Organ Mapping & Visualization: Based on the input, the system highlights the affected organs using 2D medical images.

ðŸ’Š Simulation of Treatments: We simulate how medications or surgeries may impact the affected organs using image overlays and simple transitions.

ðŸ¤– Generative AI Integration: Using GPT, we generate personalized summaries explaining the condition, medication effects, and expected outcomes in simple language.

ðŸ§¬ Future Scope: The system can eventually include a chatbot and learning-based health predictions using larger datasets.

We are using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend, with plans to integrate OpenAIâ€™s API for language generation.
